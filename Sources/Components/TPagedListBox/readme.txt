This is the source code for the TPagesListBox. In order to use it you will need to include the AnonThread.pas file located in Samples\Delphi\RTL\CrossPlatform Utils in a package. 

I would recommend that you place AnonThread in its own package as you'll probably want to use it independantly of this component as well.
